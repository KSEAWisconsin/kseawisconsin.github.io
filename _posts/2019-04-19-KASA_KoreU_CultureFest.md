The Korean-American Student Association (KASA) hosted KoreU with the purpose of providing a safe and inviting environment for those interested in learning more about Korean culture.
The event was held on April 19 from 5 to 8 PM at Gordon's Dining and Event Center. KASA brought together several Korean/Korean-American organizations and introduced Korean food, music, and language.  

KSEA-WI and KSEA-YG participated in this event by showing people how to play traditional Korean games.
